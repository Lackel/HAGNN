what can you say about a place where the waitress brings out the wrong entree, then verbally assaults your 80 year old grandmother and gives her lip about sending it back (which she did politely, by the way).	6
the prices are not terrible.	5
15% gratuity automatically added to the bill.	3
food is excellent and they also have empenadas and plaintains which are good for an afternoon snack.	2
both a number of the appetizer and pasta specials were amazing.	2
all-time favorites include the big mac, chicken mcnuggets, filet-o-fish sandwich and mcdonald's famous french fries; lighter options like entree-sized salads are also available.	2
it's a basic pizza joint, not much to look at, but the pizza is what i go for.	10

tables are close, so you better be comfortable bumping elbows with other patrons.	9
was her monday for lunch - was working on a film in the area - and found this rare jewel.	14
not too much so, but enough that there's a great scene.	11
you feel like you made it to new york when you eat here.	14
we'd walked by it dozens of times and finally settled on a monday night.	13
sum it: don't read the '10's' reviews, try it to judge for yourself so you won't have as hi expectations, then you'll be sure to enjoy it.	14
we went there, no one greeted us.	6
dug the blue bar area too.	11
we spent so much time getting elbowed around while we waited we left.	9
i got the opportunity to dine at your establishment again a few weeks ago, i was in your upstrairs dining area.	13
meat-phobes are in luck with the extraordinary veggie burger, made from a distinctive blend of chickpeas, carrots and other vegetables and spices.	2
at peak times, the restaurant is overcrowded and tables are uncomfortably close.	9
the service was on point - what else you would expect from a ritz?	8
menus feature seasonal picks, like sweet corn-foie gras brulee.	1
innovations are just as assured, from the simple carinthia cheese ravioli with wild mushrooms to the caviar-topped sturgeon, beautifully matched with a bright green spinach-vodka sauce.	2
and these are not small, wimpy fast food type burgers - these are real, full sized patties.	2
there restaurant is very casual, but perfect for lunch, and their delivery service is always very fast.	11

i had to flag down a third staff person for a fork... so now it's goodbye little rude pie company.	6
i have been in nyc for over 10 years and could not find this delicacy east of the hudson .	14
the pastas were pretty good.	2
atmosphere is a bore.	9
the decor is what initially got me in the door.	11

best hot dogs in the tri-state area.	2
this is a typical example of an establishment in which its owners do not know anything about the restaurant business!	12
i would not recommend meet at all, it is a rip off all the way from the time to step in!	12
went there for a special celebration.	13
the restaurant was quiet and intimate.	11
the service was very attentive and very generous.	8
we had tons of great food, wine, and desserts.	2
really lovely dining experience in the midst of buzzing midtown area.	14
ok, i've been to dumont a few times now.	13
the food really isn't very good and the service is terrible.	0
the food really isn't very good and the service is terrible.	6

not only do they have the best escargot in town,they always try to accomodate our toddler.	2

i've been to sotto voce several time, and i have to say this one place that hits the nail right on the head ever time!	14
between my guest and i, we sampled at least 80% of the menu, and they were all hits.	2
the deco and ambiance was really romantic.	11
this is the best unknown restaurant in and around new york.	14
just go in and sample the greatest french food west of daniel.	2
for someone who used to hate indian food, baluchi's has changed my mid.	2
finally a curry that i can eat, enjoy and not suffer from gastritis from 3 hours later.	2
all are great - poori, naan, paratha all fresh.	2
try the homemade breads.	2

i read about this place in time out magazine.	13
it's a great find in astoria.	14
great burgers, grilled cheeses and french fries.	2
the yellowfin tuna and calf's liver are my favorites!	2
sushi so fresh that it crunches in your mouth.	2
but make sure you have enough room on your credit card as the bill will leave a big dent in your wallet.	3
despite the 5th ave address there are no frills whick i also love.	11
they bring a sauce cart up to your table and offer you up to 7 or 8 choices of sauces for your steak (i tried them all).	2
not only was the sushi fresh, they also served other entrees allowed each guest something to choose from and we all left happy (try the duck!	2
after i paid for my purchase, i noticed they had not given me utensils so i could eat my pie.	6
likewise if you like really thin crust or really big slices then nick and joe's may not be your favorite.	0
it's always quiet because it's awful.	12
no green beans, no egg, no anchovy dressing, no nicoise olives, no red onion.	0
build a meal with side orders like amazin' greens salads, buffalo chicken kickers and cinna stix.	1
thick fries, meaty chili and stuffed baked potatoes round out a menu that includes a cool, ultra-thick chocolate frosty.	2
i always find myself asking the waiter to make something bland and different than what is on the menu.	1
good cake but: it was not the best cake i've ever had, and definately not worth standing outside on the sidewalk being herded like cattle by indifferent and overworked employees.	6
the closest that i got was the cherry marscapone, but they were out of it that day.	1
the homage to india is most evident in the delectable roti canai appetizer, a fried pancake served with pungent curry dipping sauce, while the mango chicken offers a surprisingly sophisticated, fresh take on sweet-and-sour.	2
i have to say the place was awesome.	14
the ground chickpea soup we sampled as a starter tasted somewhat thin.	0
we requested they re-slice the sushi, and it was returned to us in small cheese-like cubes.	0
the service, however, is a peg or two below the quality of food (horrible bartenders), and the clientele, for the most part, are rowdy, loud-mouthed commuters (this could explain the bad attitudes from the staff) getting loaded for an ac/dc concert or a knicks game.	6

if you're in the neighborhood, definitely stop by for a great meal.	2
unfortunately, with our show tickets, we didn't have time to sample any desserts.	1
the restaurant could use a little paint, but all in all a great sushi place!	14
make more tables- perhaps a rooftop bar?	9
the decoration was feeling like we was on the cairo, actually the street is part of that adventure.	11

i didn't go there for food so i can't comment.	13
my friends and i go once a week (minimum, we live in the area) and everytime can't resist walking out ready to burst.	14
stick to the items the place does best, brisket, ribs, wings, cajun shrimp is good, not great.	2
hip boutiques and bars on ludlow add to the artsy, laid-back atmosphere at this israeli-style takeout and eat-in burger joint.	11
young neighborhood trendies graze at the counter during the day, while chic, art-house drinkers with heavy doses of the munchies pile in late at night.	10
bring your date and a bottle of wine!	13
not only is this the best thai restaurant i have been to, but it also ranks as one of my favorite places to dine.	14
don't be put off by another reviewers extremely negative review.	14
my chelsea's impressive and creative menu includes modern, westernized japanese dishes such as foie gras unagi napolean, jap style hamburger steak, spicy cod roe spaghetti, black cod with miso base, and rack of lamb in black truffle sauce, to name a few.	2
his food is excellent (and not expensive by nyc standards- no entrees over $30, most appetizers $12 to 14).	2

the pasta primavera was outstanding as well, lots of fresh veggies.	2
don't get me wrong - sushi was good, just not fantastic.	2
being puerto rican i know a thing or two about flan and this place serves one of the best (i hope mom doesn't read this!).	2

the ambiance was fine, a little loud but still nice and romantic.	11
but, the filet mignon was not very good at all cocktail hour includes free appetizers (nice non-sushi selection).	5
it took about 2 1/2 hours to be served our 2 courses.	6
who said go when the place is quiet during the day?	10
can be a bit busy around peak times because of the size.	9
i was on jury duty, rode my bike up centre street on my lunch break and came across this great little place with awesome chicken tacos and hibiscus lemonade.	2

very nice touch that very much fits the place.	11
however, there is just something so great about being outdoors, in great landscaping, enjoying a casual drink that makes going to this place worthwhile.	11
we were seated promptly in close proximity to the dance floor.	13
if you are here as a pre-show meal, hop in a cab and take the extra 10 minutes to go to the uptown location.	13
a plus was the good mix of people in their twenties that provided for great eye-candy while i was there.	11
it's best to go on a cold night with a close friend or a good book.	13
slow service, but when you're hanging around with groups of 10 or 20, who really notices?	6
the sauce is excellent (very fresh) with dabs of real mozzarella.	2
don't ever bother - the drinks were awful, but it was the people who work there that really made this the worst experience at dining.	0

the room is a little plain, but it's difficult to make such a small place exciting and i would not suggest that as a reason not to go.	9
prices even outside of restaurant week were great.	5
a small, outdoor eating area makes for a private, comfortable space to study alone or meet up with friends.	11
before the place didn't call my attention.	13
and all the [female] servers are cute too, which is always nice.	8
the best dessert, a chocolate and peanut butter tart, isn't particularly hawaiian, but it's a small world when it comes to sweets.	2
for an appetizer, their calamari is a winner.	2
satay is one of those favorite haunts on washington where the service and food is always on the money.	8

after dinner i heard music playing and discovered that there is a lounge downstairs.	10
but now that it's under new ownership and has been renovated, it looks great.	11
the room is a gorgeous, bi-level space and the long bar perfect for a drink.	11
now we moved out of the state and every visit to nyc includes a stop here.	14
two complaints- their appetizer selection stinks, it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the menu.	0
i don't remember what we had; nothing was memorable.	12
it is bland and nothing extrodinary.	0
i was especially impressed during the bday party when the waitstaff went above and beyond in helping me decorate and bring out a bday cake as well as offering prompt and friendly service to a 15 person party.	8
the chicken and falafel platters were nondescript combinations with fresh leaf salad.	1
every time i visit nyc, i come here.	13
i've been coming here regularly since it opened, about 2 years ago.	13
the atmosphere takes you to that place, the place many dream of.	11
several times and put up with the waiters' bad manners, knowing that their job isn't easy.	6
the service is great (maybe even borderline nagging but at least you get attention), the desserts are excellent and the coffee is so very good...	2
we were seated next to a couple whose kitchen was being renovated and we agreed since we're all foodies who eat out a lot - that this wasn't a place we'd return to.	12
they are served on focacchia bread and are to die for.	2
the new menu has a few creative items,they were smart enough to keep some of the old favorites (but they raised the prices), the staff is friendly most of the time, but i must agree with the person that wrote about their favorite words: no, can't, sorry..., boy, they won't bend the rules for anyone.	2
