the bagels have an outstanding taste with a terrific texture, both chewy yet not gummy.	2
nevertheless the food itself is pretty good.	2
they did not have mayonnaise, forgot our toast, left out ingredients (ie cheese in an omelet), below hot temperatures and the bacon was so over cooked it crumbled on the plate when you touched it.	0

they wouldn't even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another.	8

went inside and i started to get excited.	14
i also ordered for delivery and the restaurant forgot half the order.	6

our food was great too!	2
open late (well as late as i ever got there and i'm a night person)	14
the most annoying thing, though, is the fact that the servers seem to be trained to drive revenue.	6

everything we had was pretty good, but we have only been there once.	2

it's really also the service, is good and the waiters are friendly.	8
suan was a recommendation that i am glad we heeded.	14
we visit at least once a month.	13
it is set far from the small street it's on, and there is no traffic noise.	11
also, the place is popular with families, so if you're bothered by children running loose like wild animals, come later at night to avoid them.	10

the food here does a great service to the name (cantonese that is.).	2
but, nothing stands out about the cooking.	1
joya used to be a cool spot with decent food and a colorful - if not relaxed - atmosphere.	11

i've been here 3 times for lunch and it is one of my favorites in the city.	14
i had their eggs benedict for brunch, which were the worst in my entire life, i tried removing the hollandaise sauce completely that was how failed it was.	0
i work near-by, and they have the best oatmeal in the neighborhood- not a packaged or quick-cooked item.	2
too bad the food wasn't of the same heritage.	0
the menu looked good, except for offering the chilean sea bass, but the server does not offer up the specials that were written on the board outside.	6
sexy.	14
the food was really good, i had the onion soup and it was one of the best ever.	2
i will have to say, this bengali fast food joint is clearly my favorite.	14
i'm not picky - but it was actually gross.	0
overall, a solid restaurant and at less than $40pp (including wine), a solid deal as well.	14

since it literally is a complete hole in the wall, it's a bit intimidating at first, but you get over that very quickly as soon as the friendly staff welcomes you - don't hesitate to ask for help with what to get.	8

it costs $2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out roll, but the roll more than triples in size, and that's not just from the rice.	1

even with john's and joe's around the corner, this place will make a name for itself.	14
it melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency, not too fishy, creamy, and slightly buttery.	2
when he finally did, he was unable to make a gin and tonic -- couldn't find tonic.	6
my girlfriend convinced me to go in the other night for a quick bite.	13
the dim sum is ok but doesn't taste that fresh, and the little dishes don't look steamy hot as they should (also note lack of chinese here).	0
despite the untasteful previous review.	13
don't judge this place prima facie, you have to try it to believe it, a home away from home for the literate heart.	14
sure, everyone's got their favorite, but to know sal, is to know new york.	13
i think that it is absolutely brilliant and well-run business operation.	14
also they were $15 each!	3
my friends spoke so much about it for months, i finally made the time to come down ear and dine in.	13
if you want good authentic thai this place is not the place to go.	0
i recommend getting a reservation even though we saw people seated without one.	13
the only thing i moderately enjoyed was their grilled chicken special with edamame puree.	1
this is as good as neighborhood restaurants come.	13
if you want some roast duck, pork or chicken on rice with ginger, try them out!	2
you order from a menu, so you leave feeling like you missed the full experience.	12
one of the more authentic shanghainese restaurants in the us definitely the best in manhattan chinatown.	14
we will go back every time we are in the city.	14
we love th pink pony.	14
so eat fast and order a lot.	13
staff is very accommodating.	8
i have to agree with the previous reviewer.	13
--eat club is a roving group of nyc gluttons	13
if you were there when it first opened, give this restaurant a second chance.	14
i went to del frisco's friday night with my boyfriend for an 8:00 reservation.	13
if you like sakagura but you feel it's too much, you'd better try yokocho.	13
yourself a favor and have dinner here and see if you don't agree with me.	14
definitely a great spot for a nice occasion or date.	14
you can't go wrong with this place.	14
very popular style izakaya (sake and small portion of sake friendly dishes ).	2

fresh ingredients and everything is made to order.	2
we have never had any problems with charging the meal or the tip, and the food was delivered quickly, but we live only a few minutes walk from them.	8
quick and friendly service.	8
authentic bistro!	14
somewhat pricey but what the heck.	3
it's true, this place is not cheap.	3
try the hot dogs too, they're snappy and delicious.	2
delivery is fast too.	8
being from the south, there aren't any good delis in my area and while watching foods across america on pbs i found out about katz's deli.	13
the noise level was unbearable, conversation impossible.	9
personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights.	2
highly recommended is the spicy fried clam rolls and spider rolls.	2
one of the earlier people commenting on the restaurant did not get the that some experimenting is going on with the menu in a positive way.	14
it's convenient.	14
thanks bloom's for a lovely trip.	14
the atmosphere is great if your looking for a laid back scene and an inexpensive way to spend a weekend afternoon.	11

oh right, i should probably say something nice.	13
odd for ave b, not just odd, the place attracts an eclectic crowd to say the least.	10
when we stumbled on leon, we thought that we had found quite the gem but, we were certainly wrong.	12
instead of wasting your time here: support restaurants that care about food.	12
this is can became on e of the ny italian food fare institutions.	13
just got back from lunch at tamarind and it was excellent.	2
head and shoulders above its neighbors on east 6 st, taj mahal is also very comparable, in food quality, to the much overpraised (and under deserving) baluchi's.	2
the man that was hosting promised to save a table for our party of 7, then sat a party of 2 at the very table he was saving (mean while there were booths open all around).	6
try the cheesecake!	2
as we were sitting eating the subpar food the manager proceeded to berate a couple of his employees for putting out the wrong containers for condiments and explained to them how expensive these containers were.	6

we ordered a tuna melt - it came with out cheese which just made it a tuna sandwich.	0
especially liked chicken tikka and the naan, and the dals.	2
the waiters were not attentive except that the bill turned up on the table before we were finished.	6
the restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the hudson river and the statue of liberty.	11
we generally like good restaurants and eat out often but kai was way to expensive for what we got.	3
what a great place.	14
the sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day.	2
don't eat here unless you're starving for thai food and you work next door.	12

you could get a much better dining experience for the same amount of money in a lot of other french bistros.	12

it's better than being on the roof of sutton place with 19 year old interns jabbing you in the ribs all night.	14
service has always been friendly and efficient.	8
went there and had a combination of different seafood dishes and appetizers.	1
its a great place for a casual date or to entertain clients for lunch.	14
all we received was an apology as we left to see our show without dinner.	6
the table next to us asked if he crushed the grapes himself when their long overdue bottle of wine finally arrived.	6
prices are very good.	5
we could not catch our waiter's eye, and he ignored us.	6
fantastic place.	14
plain and simple it's bad thai food.	0
definitely not a restaurant to skip!	14
they refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends.	6
usually 3 vs. 4 items per dish.	1

the hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out.	6
i must say the view of nyc is so beautiful!	11

we ate here in march, 2006 and ordered the pre-theatre 3-course dinner with wine flight.	1
definitely check it out!!!	14
probably much busier for lunch, it's seldom crowded for dinner (too close to downtown).	10
their calzones are horrific, bad, vomit-inducing, yuck.	0
it takes forever to get a drink and they almost always forget to bring something (although they don't forget to charge you for it.	6

saturday, nov. 6th i had a group from work come in with about 35 people and the staff was amazing to accommodate us.	8
good spreads, great beverage selections and bagels really tasty.	2
first, the waiter who served us neglected to fill us in on the specials, which i would have chosen had i known about them.	6
we will be back.	14
also, top the meal with a delicious and perfect slice of tiramisu.	2
it seems like this is a place the locals like and the people working here liked it too.	14
check out the secret back room.	11
it's also attached to angel's share, which is a cool, more romantic bar.	11
authentic food and they have real service, not just the rush you get sometimes when they try to push you out the door.	2

also very inexpensive.	5
we've only eaten in the restaurant once, but we have ordered many times for dinner.	13
i got enough reasons to keep coming back!!!	14
by far this is the only chinese desserts place i know in ny or anywhere close in the northeastern america that serves desserts with frog jelly in a couple of varieties and pig feet ginger simmered in black vinegar.	2

you cannot go wrong with this place.	14
it is the type of place to run into old friends and have a late, raucus dinner.	14
the food is delicious - from the specials to the regular menu-fare, the dishes are never a disappointment.	2
prices are in line.	4
the combination of fresh tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella cheese, basil and the dough they make with imported flour, makes this is one of the better pizza's in ny.	2
the food is prepared quickly and efficiently.	2
and for this i had to shell out a small fortune?	3
for all of you new to indian food, try the paneer roll, it is a piece of heaven.	2
the food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates.	2
both the fresh mozzarella slices and the plain cheese slice are phenomenal.	2

unfortunately, the food was not something to get worked up about.	0
it's constantly open, catering to the pakistani cabbies lined up on crosby st., so there's more turnover with the food than you'd expect (i.e., surprisingly fresh).	2

- the bread at the beginning is super tasty and makes you want more - the pizza is delicious and comes in personal sizes, however be warned that the peter's favourite pizza with prosciutto and baby arugula is actually a margarite pizza with cold prosciutto and baby arugula on top, like a salad.	2
the large selection of bruschetta, panini, tramezzino keep the palate from stagnating.	2
have always found that the waiters will go out of their way to be helpful, despite the fact they are often busy with lots of diners.	8

i would go back tho.	14
the photobook menu was a cute touch, certainly helped my group and i pick the fried chicken, pork chop, and noodle dishes that we all ordered.	2
too large for just two people but nothing was left.	2
i cannot imagine better indian food in all of the city.	2
great romantic place for a date (try to get the corner booth table for a little privacy and to sit close!).	11
a pleasant surprise.	14
i asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere!	6
we got most of it back at home with us.	13
get there before 7pm.	13
very good breads as well.	2

my first encounter happened one friday evening with a friend.	13
example is the soup which was about 6 oz for $12 dollars and the mushrooms where $12 for about 1oz.	5
there are other people waiting!	7
from beginning appetizers, the scallops were incredible, to the delicious chocolate souffle with raspberry mint sorbet, we were delighted by the taste sensations.	2
ou must try this restaurant.	14
we left, never to return.	12
consistently good japanese tapas.	2
no apologies during restaurant week.	12

they also do a great job for restaurant week.	14
i went to this restaurant with a woman that i met recently.	13
the dishes offered were unique, very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages, sardines with biscuits, large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream (the best and freshest i've ever had).	2
this is where the aforementioned line was.	13

very excited to hear that short-term chef jason narone has moved on, he truly was a low point of their sterling track record.	12

well worth the trip, close to city hall and downtown subway stops.	14

the sauce on the pizza is so good with garlic and fresh tomatoes and they don't skimp.	2
we recently decided to try this location, and to our delight, they have outdoor seating, perfect since i had my yorkie with me.	11
my husband had the mesclun, salmon, and ice cream and he enjoyed all 3 courses.	2

still, any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own measures of liqueurs which were courtesy of the house.	2

katz's has been a nyc original for over 100 years.	14
you can get an excellent meal at most of the many indian restaurants on nearby lexington avenue for the cost of one the dainty dishes here.	3
the pastrami sandwich was like buttah and with pickles and an icy cold beer to wash it down, it was a pleasurable experience.	2
the plain pizza was soggy and the creative wild mushroom(third generation fornini) pizza we had was drenched with truffle oil in the middle( again making it soggy) and nothing on the rest.	0
late nite omelettes are not good here, there is no variety!	0
everything at sala thai is tasty and well-portioned.	2

the outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful.	11
a large is $20, and toppings are about $3 each.	3

besides having the table we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated, we were served dishes we hadn't ordered three times, received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been served (and that order was undercooked), and charged $45 more than we should have been on our bill.	6

the food at this place is gourmet indian cuisine.	1
finally a reliable chinese restaurant!	14
get over it!	13
but the thing that my wife and i hated was it was so loud and it felt like bar or pub.	9
however, it just so happens that there's an even more amazing place just down the street.	14
while there are plenty of places to go for a good corned beef sandwich, katz's has a charm about it.	2
however, looking at the table next to ours, we both sort of wished we had ordered pizza, which looked perfect.	2
priced at upper intermediate range.	3
i recommend ordering in on a weeknight.	14

my husband said the portions were very small, but if my main course was good to eat the portion would've been fine for me.	0
but the thai is definitely not great -- bland and undistinguished.	0
this thai restaurant is a couple blocks away from sripraphai (another delicious thai restaurant).	13
great for groups, great for a date, great for early brunch or a nightcap.	11
authentic shanghai style and i cannot recommend a better shanghai place in new york.	11
our friendly server made great food suggestions and also sent both the sommelier and the fromager to the table to help suggest different pairings for wine and cheese.	8
that said, i thought scalini fedeli was one of the best dining experiences i've ever had.	14
everything about this restaurant was special.	14
because we didn't have a reservation, we could only sit in the back garden, but it was great, secluded and perfect in nice weather.	11

best dish is nori-wrapped tuna.	2

we have tried every thai restaurant between atlantic avenue and 4th streets, and joya is the best.	14
immediately after we paid, the waiter took the money and said, okay, you guys are outta here.	6
the dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over -- how refreshing!	11
admittedly, this is not the place for gigantic pieces of fish overflowing the plate (and thank goodness, in my opinion) but for simple, elegant sushi there is no better place in new york or anywhere in the us.	2
i am a die hard peep lover.	14
once you become a regular, you are treated as one.	8

i found the variety of the sashimi plate to be satisfying - fresh and yummy.	2
and forget what you read under me, the atmosphere isn't that bad either.	10
don't waste your time, or money!!	12
they don't concern much of customer's health, just want to make money.	12
we couldn't carry our conversation as we were routinely interrupted by waitress and servants asking us to order and hinting that we're taking too much time -- amazing, we just sat down.	6

one would think we'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead, we got a snobby waiter wouldn't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so.	6

after hearing a lot of great things about the restaurant, and passing by it on a daily basis, we decided to try.	13
the service, however, was a bright flower in a garden.	8
so, again, give it a try.	14
stay far away from this place.	12
we will come back!!!	14
we've been to grocery three times and not once has an item on the menu disappointed.	2
a touch more jalapeno heat for contrast and it would have been very good indeed.	2
tried the pad see ew on the recommendation of the last reviewer since it's one of my favorite dishes.	1

i have never eaten in the restaurant, however, upon reading the reviews i got take out last week.	13
once for dinner and once for brunch.	13

the staff are attentive, and have smiles on their faces.	8
this is the best shabu-shabu restaurant in the try-state area.	2
no dress codes, no attitudes, plenty of comfort companionship, a great place to relax in an always busy midtown.	11
largest and freshest pieces of sushi, and delicious!	2
even the pasta is delicious here (a rarity in new york pizza restaurants).	2
but when we looked at the menu, there weren't a lot of choices, most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section.	0
maybe i say so because it looked promising for people who like artery-clogging jewish deli food, but turns out to be poorly run and awful.	6
after my 3rd time the manager remembered me and treated me like an usual customer.	8
this place is greatly welcome in the desolate little strip between the prospect expressway and greenwood cemetery - a wasteland we like to call the sliv.	14
now if they could only get a toaster.	12
you will find yourself returning quite often.	14

i come from a family of pizzeria owners, and i'm almost ashamed to say that the pizza in fornino's blows my families receipts away.	2

a million better places to go in the city.	12
okay, i don't mind the oily part (cause most are cooked that way) but it was way too bland.	0

i had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible.	2
i must say it's a little pricey for the food because it was not as spectacular as the view.	3
these innovators of french indian fusion do a great job of making dishes as interesting as possible while still being accessible.	2
just don't take the seat between the bar and the back half of the restaurant, i saw a woman get nudged 40times sitting there.	9
no gimmicks here -- the food speaks for itself in its freshness and preparation.	2
we were worried we would have trouble getting in, but somehow managed to have a short wait.	14

try the green curry!!!	2
we had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful.	2
we were also seated promptly at the time of our reservation and the service was very quick and professional.	8

great wine selection, gigondas is worth the price, and the house champagne is a great value.	2
at night, but it's hard to hear your own conversation with everyone else competing for that same luxury - the music playing in the background is also voluminous.	9
it just wasn't thai.	12

service is average.	7
but they've done a really nice job of offering all the typical pizzeria faves plus some terrific specials like the godmother pizza (a sort of traditional flat pizza with an olive oil-brushed crust and less tomato sauce than usual).	2
go girls!!!	14
they forgot a sandwich, didn't include plastic forks, and didn't include pita with the hummus platter.	6
the steak is good, the fish is good and the sushi was surprisingly great.	2
for asian fusion, there are many places further downtown.	13
old school meets new world.	13

also, the sandwiches (nearing $7) didn't come with anything like chips or a side.	3
and never strayed.	14
the wait here is long for dim sum, but if you don't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig, this is a sleek (for chinatown) alternative.	11
leave the kids at home!	13

the prices are about $9 for an entree for dinner and even less for lunch.	5

(food was delivered by a busboy, not waiter) we got no cheese offered for the pasta, our water and wine glasses remained empty our entire meal, when we would have easily spent another $20 on wine.	6
the takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well.	8

off the beaten path, this jewel of a restaurant shines just one block away from the plethora of 6th street indian restaurants.	14

this is definitely an excellent date spot because of the ambiance and on the weekends the night scene is more than alive.	11

we asked to be moved (which took half an hour), and then were seated in a high traffic area in the back, even though the rest of the room was practically empty.	6
good to find a restaurant where the owners have some imagination and they have actually pulled it off, like in this case.	14
however, their popularity has yet to slow down, and i still find myself drawn to their ambiance and delectable reputation.	14

obviously the chinese translation of this place does not mean big wong, it actually means great prosperity.	13

their whitefish salad is excellent--all whitefish with a little mayo.	2
and it all comes at a very reasonable price (congee, noodles, and rice dishes are no more than $3-6 each).	5
nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end, not one person takes responsibility for anything.	6
i had a great experience.	14
the chicken parm was edible but had canned tomato sauce and boxed pasta and the chicken with portobello mushrooms consisted of dry, inedible chicken with terrible sauce.	0
i recommend this place to everyone who asks me where to go for a good meal.	14

our son loves pizza and we have a certified neapolitan pizzaria in our home city (seattle), we liked this nearly as much - and the differences were more about personal preference than any reflection on either restaurant.	14

i really didn't know what to expect for a restaurant that literally overlooks the main hall of grand central.	13
none of that yucky whipped stuff.	2
the wine list isn't great, and the desserts are shipped in from bruno's down the street, which is not as good as it used to be.	0

their coffee is quite good too!	2
i would not recommend this place to anyone.	12
great wine list (italian), good food, service was initially fine.	2
despite the fact that the space is large, they've overcrowded the floor with tables.	9
i know, you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored, but my agenda is i'm here to eat and enjoy the company of friends, seeking a pleasant experience.	6
they are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret choosing this place, but also become hostile!	6
i had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish ive requested.	6
normally that would be improper, however they were all delicious and my host did not complain.	2
taxan delicious!	2
perhaps it was an off night, but it was surprisingly average for a 9.3 rating.	12
unlike other places in nyc where the sandwiches you want only come as a triple-decker, here you can get what you want in a reasonably sized portion (and price).	5
southern indian cuisine is still there, too.	1
restaurant snobs need not bother, this is a small, neighborhood kind of place.	13
have been dozens of times and never failed to enjoy the experience.	14
they couldn't even make a salad that was appealing.	0
for two people with tip was less than $25 bucks.	5

much of the time it seems like they do not care about you.	6

it is one the nicest outdoor restaurants i have ever seen in ny--i am from italy and this place rivals the ones in my country.	11
yes you have to wait to be seated and because its small there is no waiting area and the seat at the bar was all taken.	9

i didn't expect to like nosh as much as i did, but the pastrami on challah sandwich i had was otherworldly, the soups are like mom's, and the knishes give yonah schimmel's a run for its money.	2
the atmosphere is nothing special, but it feels like a sushi establishment in tokyo.	10
cozy romantic atmosphere with only around 15 tables at most.	11

complimentary stuff kept coming, and when the waiter saw me opening a gift, i received my dessert on a plate that had happy birthday written on it, with a candleberry nice touch, and attentive staff.	8

this is the only thai place i go too in nyc, it's wonderful, and live relaxed jazz on certain nights.	11
we will be back.	14
we were seated and ignored by staff.	6
if you are in a big group, this place is perfect because it recommends sharing - they have lazy susans on most tables - even families can feel comfortable here.	11

we were then shooed inside.	6
we got in line and were served while in line a bannan fritter.	13
it might have been a little too spicy for my friend, which you can counteract with eat more rice and keeping water on hand.	1
this place is always very crowded and popular.	11
appetizers are somewhere around $7 each and the main dishes are between $11 and $16.	4

just went here for my girlfriends 23rd bday.	13
my wife and i went to orsay for valentine's dinner.	13
i don't know about you guys, but when i go somewhere to eat i go for the food not for the atmosphere.	13
a gentleman, maybe the manager, came to our table, and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order.	6
very different than regular dimsum places.	13

i grew up on these bagels.	14
we were told that they were booked solid and no other table was available.	6
the restaurant is very small so reservations are a must.	13
visited there while on vacation and reading the reviews.	13

you can't go wrong here.	14
at first i was rolling my ideas of yet another french place on the ues.	13
to my right, the hostess stood over a busboy and hissed rapido, rapido as he tried to clear and re-set a table for six.	6
in china the phrase for a good restaurant is hot and loud.	13
after dealing with subpar pizza all over the kensington neighborhood - i've found little toninos.	14

then we ordered a dinosaur rolls and white tuna sashimi.	1
you won't find that anywhere in manhattan.	14

i went here in the afternoon with a friend.	13
our first greeting when we entered was the last call is at 10:15.	6

i'm partial to the gnocchi.	2
i guess the way my friends and i described it was the french colonies.	13

note that they do not serve beer, you must bring your own.	6
we ate outside at haru's sake bar because haru's restaurant next door was overflowing.	13
when we walked in it seemed like it was there for 200 years.	13
ahhh.	13
better than the bagel shop on the corner, but not worth going out of your way for, in my opinion.	12
it helps if you know what to order.	13
the service was typical short-order, dinner type.	7
we shared a bottle of sake, an order of edamames, and she had the sushi plate while i had the sashimi.	1
i can't believe people complain about no cheese sticks?	13
but that is highly forgivable.	14
from the appetizers we ate, the dim sum and other variety of foods, it was impossible to criticize the food.	2
when we arrived at 6:00 pm, the restaurant was practically empty.	13
each table has a pot of boiling water sunken into its surface, and you get platters of thin sliced meats, various vegetables, and rice and glass noodles.	1
i am going to the mid town location next.	13
the bread is top notch as well.	2
i have to say they have one of the fastest delivery times in the city.	8

did i mention that the coffee is outstanding?	2
certainly not the best sushi in new york, however, it is always fresh, and the place is very clean, sterile.	11

my favs here are the tacos pastor and the tostada de tinga...	2
nick stef's is one of the only places worthy of going in the area, so if you happen to be by madison square garden or herald's square check it out!	14

believe me, they live up to the name.	14
well, it happened because of a graceless manager and a rude bartender who had us waiting 20 minutes for drinks, and then tells us to chill out.	6

good cake but: it was not the best cake i've ever had, and definately not worth standing outside on the sidewalk being herded like cattle by indifferent and overworked employees.	6
the closest that i got was the cherry marscapone, but they were out of it that day.	1
the homage to india is most evident in the delectable roti canai appetizer, a fried pancake served with pungent curry dipping sauce, while the mango chicken offers a surprisingly sophisticated, fresh take on sweet-and-sour.	2
i have to say the place was awesome.	14
the ground chickpea soup we sampled as a starter tasted somewhat thin.	0
we requested they re-slice the sushi, and it was returned to us in small cheese-like cubes.	0
the service, however, is a peg or two below the quality of food (horrible bartenders), and the clientele, for the most part, are rowdy, loud-mouthed commuters (this could explain the bad attitudes from the staff) getting loaded for an ac/dc concert or a knicks game.	6

if you're in the neighborhood, definitely stop by for a great meal.	2
unfortunately, with our show tickets, we didn't have time to sample any desserts.	1
the restaurant could use a little paint, but all in all a great sushi place!	14
make more tables- perhaps a rooftop bar?	9
the decoration was feeling like we was on the cairo, actually the street is part of that adventure.	11

i didn't go there for food so i can't comment.	13
my friends and i go once a week (minimum, we live in the area) and everytime can't resist walking out ready to burst.	14
stick to the items the place does best, brisket, ribs, wings, cajun shrimp is good, not great.	2
hip boutiques and bars on ludlow add to the artsy, laid-back atmosphere at this israeli-style takeout and eat-in burger joint.	11
young neighborhood trendies graze at the counter during the day, while chic, art-house drinkers with heavy doses of the munchies pile in late at night.	10
bring your date and a bottle of wine!	13
not only is this the best thai restaurant i have been to, but it also ranks as one of my favorite places to dine.	14
don't be put off by another reviewers extremely negative review.	14
my chelsea's impressive and creative menu includes modern, westernized japanese dishes such as foie gras unagi napolean, jap style hamburger steak, spicy cod roe spaghetti, black cod with miso base, and rack of lamb in black truffle sauce, to name a few.	2
his food is excellent (and not expensive by nyc standards- no entrees over $30, most appetizers $12 to 14).	2

the food is consistant and good but how it got name best diner in manhattan is beyond me.	2
the pasta primavera was outstanding as well, lots of fresh veggies.	2
don't get me wrong - sushi was good, just not fantastic.	2
being puerto rican i know a thing or two about flan and this place serves one of the best (i hope mom doesn't read this!).	2
been to the one in brooklyn for over 25 years, now i dont have to go over the bridge for the best pizza ....hanx	2
had dinner here on a friday and the food was great.	2

highly recommended...  as stated, i haven't dined *in* the restaurant but stopped by there to pick up takeout and it seems a very relaxing place; also, the bar looks nice.	11

the ambiance was fine, a little loud but still nice and romantic.	11
but, the filet mignon was not very good at all cocktail hour includes free appetizers (nice non-sushi selection).	5
it took about 2 1/2 hours to be served our 2 courses.	6
who said go when the place is quiet during the day?	10
can be a bit busy around peak times because of the size.	9
i was on jury duty, rode my bike up centre street on my lunch break and came across this great little place with awesome chicken tacos and hibiscus lemonade.	2

very nice touch that very much fits the place.	11
however, there is just something so great about being outdoors, in great landscaping, enjoying a casual drink that makes going to this place worthwhile.	11
we were seated promptly in close proximity to the dance floor.	13
if you are here as a pre-show meal, hop in a cab and take the extra 10 minutes to go to the uptown location.	13
a plus was the good mix of people in their twenties that provided for great eye-candy while i was there.	11
it's best to go on a cold night with a close friend or a good book.	13
slow service, but when you're hanging around with groups of 10 or 20, who really notices?	6
the sauce is excellent (very fresh) with dabs of real mozzarella.	2
don't ever bother - the drinks were awful, but it was the people who work there that really made this the worst experience at dining.	0

the room is a little plain, but it's difficult to make such a small place exciting and i would not suggest that as a reason not to go.	9
prices even outside of restaurant week were great.	5
a small, outdoor eating area makes for a private, comfortable space to study alone or meet up with friends.	11
before the place didn't call my attention.	13
and all the [female] servers are cute too, which is always nice.	8
the best dessert, a chocolate and peanut butter tart, isn't particularly hawaiian, but it's a small world when it comes to sweets.	2
for an appetizer, their calamari is a winner.	2
satay is one of those favorite haunts on washington where the service and food is always on the money.	8

after dinner i heard music playing and discovered that there is a lounge downstairs.	10
but now that it's under new ownership and has been renovated, it looks great.	11
the room is a gorgeous, bi-level space and the long bar perfect for a drink.	11
now we moved out of the state and every visit to nyc includes a stop here.	14
two complaints- their appetizer selection stinks, it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the menu.	0
i don't remember what we had; nothing was memorable.	12
it is bland and nothing extrodinary.	0
i was especially impressed during the bday party when the waitstaff went above and beyond in helping me decorate and bring out a bday cake as well as offering prompt and friendly service to a 15 person party.	8
the chicken and falafel platters were nondescript combinations with fresh leaf salad.	1
every time i visit nyc, i come here.	13
i've been coming here regularly since it opened, about 2 years ago.	13
the atmosphere takes you to that place, the place many dream of.	11
several times and put up with the waiters' bad manners, knowing that their job isn't easy.	6
the service is great (maybe even borderline nagging but at least you get attention), the desserts are excellent and the coffee is so very good...	2
we were seated next to a couple whose kitchen was being renovated and we agreed since we're all foodies who eat out a lot - that this wasn't a place we'd return to.	12
they are served on focacchia bread and are to die for.	2
the new menu has a few creative items,they were smart enough to keep some of the old favorites (but they raised the prices), the staff is friendly most of the time, but i must agree with the person that wrote about their favorite words: no, can't, sorry..., boy, they won't bend the rules for anyone.	2

if you like seafood and/or greek food you will love this place though it is not limited to just these things.	2
" the menu includes pub fare--burgers, steaks and shepherds pie--and even a portabella lasagna for those black sheep known as "vegetarians.	1

i just had my first visit to this place and can't wait to go back and slowly work my way through the menu.	14
i asked repeatedly what the status of the meal was and was pretty much grunted at by the unbelievably rude waiter.	6

i stopped by for some brunch today and had the vegan cranberry pancakes and some rice milk.	1
sweet irish bartender is always happy and able to bring a smile to my friends a my face.	8
i always find myself sitting next to someone in the theatre industry- interesting to hear ideas hashed out while having a quick bite to eat.	14
its good to go there for drinks if you don't want to get drunk because you'll be lucky if you can get one drink an hour the service is so bad.	6
anyway, the owner was fake.	6
owner is pleasant and entertaining.	8
i have never in my life sent back food before, but i simply had to, and the waiter argued with me over this.	0

creamy appetizers--taramasalata, eggplant salad, and greek yogurt (with cuccumber, dill, and garlic) taste excellent when on warm pitas.	2
